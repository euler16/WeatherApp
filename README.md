- Google Maps API
  - Used for the map and allowing the user to locate themselves or select a location the view the weather of
- VueJS
  - The MVC framework to build the application.
- ChartJS
  - The charting library to create a graph to show the maximum and minimum temperature over the days.
- DarkSky API
  - Weather API to pull weather data from
- Materialize

**Note**: The DarkSky API key currently present in the code has been reset so you will need to request your own individual key to be able to retrieve the weather data. This can be done by creating an account at [their website](https://darksky.net/dev)
